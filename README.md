If you're a server owner, here's a list of useful stuff for you.

Before you start the gamemode, remove various addons that are meant for building - they might mess the gamemode up.
Too many mods = long downloads, higher ping, more stuff to network that isn't even supposed to be networked, because 
the gamemode isn't sandbox.

You'll find a folder called "content to be put in the server's folder". Everything inside must be copy/cut-pasted into the server's main directory.
The directory is garrysmod/garrysmod (the folder where all the models, materials sound and other folders are)

# Serverside console variables:
ta_respawntime_rebel - (default - 5) time it takes for a rebel to respawn

ta_respawntime_combine - (default - 5) time it takes for a combine to respawn

ta_rounds - (default - 4) amount of rounds per map, can support as much rounds as you want (if you want to, you can set it to 9001 rounds)

ta_timelimit_tdm - (default - 15) time in minutes until a new round in the "Team Deathmatch" gametype starts

ta_timelimit_comsab - (default - 10) time in minutes until a new round in the "Communications Sabotage" gametype starts
